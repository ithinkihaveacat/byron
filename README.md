# Overview

A little library for doing a few things with PHP, the most interesting
being config management/service discovery and DOM manipulation.  The
services have a dependency on Zend Framework's HTTP client; there
might be some other ZF dependencies as well.

# Is the API stable?

Hahahahahaha.
