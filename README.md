# Overview

A little library for doing a few things with PHP, the most interesting
being config management/service discovery and DOM manipulation.  (See
the `tests` directory.)  The services have a dependency on Zend
Framework's HTTP client; there might be some other ZF dependencies as
well.

# Is the API stable?

Hahahahahaha.

# Requirements

    $ ./configure --enable-mbstring --with-openssl --with-xsl && make && make install
